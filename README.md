## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/dawoodarain3/fake-news-detector.git
cd fake-news-detector

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Train model (optional)
python train_model.py

# Launch the app
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## Download My Custom Model

You can download the **fine-tuned BERT model (RB-1)** from Kaggle and skip training from scratch.

### ðŸ”— [Download Custom Model from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/models/dawoodarain/fake_news_model)

> **Note:** Make sure you have a Kaggle account and are logged in to access the dataset.

### How to Use the Model

1. Download the ZIP file containing the custom model from Kaggle  
2. Extract the ZIP contents into the `fake_news_model/` directory (create it if it doesnâ€™t exist):

```bash
# Example shell commands (Linux/macOS/WSL)
mkdir -p fake_news_model
unzip /path/to/downloaded_model.zip -d fake_news_model/


---

## Model Training

The `train_model.py` script includes:
- Fine-tuning BERT on real/fake news data
- Visualization of training and validation performance
- Model saving to `./fake_news_model/`

Outputs include:
- Training and validation loss plots  
- Accuracy graphs  
- Confusion matrix  
- Classification report  

---

## Web Application Overview

The `app.py` Streamlit app includes:
- Model selection (RB-1 or demo)
- Input field for text or use of sample articles
- Instant predictions with confidence scoring
- Visual display of probability distribution

---

## Usage

1. Select the model (RB-1 for best performance)  
2. Input your news article or choose a sample  
3. Click analyze to get the result  
4. Review the prediction and confidence score

## Model Performance

| Model      | Description                         | Recommended |
|------------|-------------------------------------|-------------|
| RB-1       | Fine-tuned BERT on fake news data   | Yes         |
| Demo       | Base BERT without tuning            | No          |

- Confidence score indicates prediction certainty  
- Color-coded output: Green for Real, Red for Fake  

Example:  
```
Input: "Scientists discover miracle pill for instant weight loss..."
Output: SUSPICIOUS NEWS (Confidence: 92.1%)
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`: Set GPU device (optional)  
- `TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM`: Set to false to suppress warnings  

### Model Settings
- Max tokens: 256  
- Device: Auto-detection (CPU or GPU)  
- Batch size: 1 (for real-time inference)  

---

## Troubleshooting

**Model Not Loading**  
- Ensure `./fake_news_model/` directory and model files exist  
- Check file permissions and directory structure  

**CUDA Memory Error**  
- Switch to CPU mode by setting `device = torch.device('cpu')`  
- Reduce input length or batch size  

**Slow Performance**  
- Enable GPU if available  
- Reduce input text size  
- Close unnecessary background applications  

---

## Future Enhancements

- Multi-language support  
- Integration with advanced models (RoBERTa, DistilBERT)  
- Real-time URL analysis  
- Batch processing  
- REST API support  
- Mobile responsiveness  
- Report exporting
